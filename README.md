# playnext

This is a simple script that you can drop into a folder with a video series and it will play the next one in the series (eg. if you download a season of some anime and you want to keep track of where you're at).

It creates a ilst of the file names in a folder and iterates through them, ignoring .csv, .txt, and .py.
